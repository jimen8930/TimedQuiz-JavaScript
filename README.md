# TimedQuiz-JavaScript


I developed this quiz to learn how to manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript.

-In this project you will see multiple functions to activate several buttons.
-I added event listners so when the users can activate a code in javascript which makes it interactive. 
-In this project, there is a timer, clear interval, and set interval which will display on the screen then disappear.
-There is an array with objects that include questions, choices, correct and wrong booloens.
-

The timer starts When you click the "Start Quiz". Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty and a lower score. Once the user click their answer another question will appear. The user will receive a final score at the end. The user will have to enter thier initilas and will return with a high score scrren. Sfter they received their initials and score, they will the option to go back or clear high scores. 

The files that were used are the following;
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
